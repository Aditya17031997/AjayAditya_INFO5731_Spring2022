              "      <th>i had low expectations for this movie  first off  the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal  it's so god damn beautifully well done  the storyline is extremely brilliant where it explores how this man found the ten rings that gifted him with unlimited power and immortality that kept him alive for thousands of years  would create an organization known as the ten rings who would later be responsible for the kidnapping of tony stark in afghanistan  aldrich killian's madness after their job  the two ride on a bus  but only to encounter the ten rings and a guy with a \"freakin' machete\"  i have to say  though  this scene's choreography was god damn great  and the music made it even better  after the attack  katy begins to question shang's motives  shang explains the backstory of how he came to be  and that he needed to go visit his long lost sister  they take the airplane to china  the two arrive in this underground fighting club that was broadcasted to the dark web only to encounter a guy who told him to sign to fight  even though shang didn't know what he was signing up for  we get to see a cameo of the abomination fighting wong  i have to say that the cgi was better on him in every level  i am quite glad that the writers are starting to acknowledge the incredible hulk  shang is up to fight an unknown opponent  and it is revealed that it is his sister  shang tries to talk to her that he doesn't want to fight which basically led to him getting his *** kicked  (( have to put asterisks so that imdb won't delete this review  so don't be surprised  ))after the fight  shang tells his sister  xialing about the ten rings situation  they soon realize that the ten rings attack the club which leads us to another action scene  unrelated  but i have noticed that people have been complaining that mcu heroes don't kill  i'm pretty sure that they did kill since the beginning where iron man used his mark i to light his victims on fire  blowing up multiple people  fatal blasts  etc  the death dealer steals xialing's pendant  capturing the three of them to the ten rings headquarters to reunite with their father waiting for them  back at the headquarters  wenwu explains how there is still hope to save their mother by finding ta lo to save ying  wenwu uses the two pendants to place them on the dragon's eyes generating a map made of water showing them the secret passage through the bamboo maze  and the perfect time where it can be granted  wenwu tells them that if the people of ta lo won't comply  he will burn down the village with no mercy  shang is against this  wenwu throws them in the catacombs  the three hear some weird noises only to encounter trevor who was the fake mandarin in iron man 3! if you didn't know  there was a short that explains slattery's experience in jail  in the end  he is captured by the ten rings  morris comes out of the corner  telling trevor the true path xialing discovers that there are escape routes  the team hijacks razor's car which leads us to another fight sequence  they soon approach the bamboo forest maze  katy is assisted where to turn by morris and slattery  finally  they enter a waterfall  arriving at the ta lo village  guang bo tells the group to turn back  ying nan delays that order  meeting her niece and nephew  although  i did realize this was michelle yeoh who portrayed philippa georgiou in star trek: discovery  i do need to catch up as i lost interest  ying tells them a story where in ancient times  their village was attacked by this extra dimensional draconic entity who can suck the ever living souls out of people and its minions can  too  but  the great protector  and sealed away behind the dark gate  trapping it for many centuries  here  we have a training montage where we see shang chi being trained in the same arts that were used to defeat wenwu  xialing practices with this what seems to be a rope dart  and chen learning archery  the next day  wenwu and the ten rings  also razor fist  and the death dealer arrive  nan tells wenwu that his wife isn't behind the dark gate  but the soul eaters were luring him to a trap we begin the climactic third act  nan fights with the death sealer  xialing fights razor fist  meanwhile  shang notices his father walking away to his wife's memorial  but is distracted by several warriors for a brief moment  as he approaches his father  he told him that he isn't afraid  episode v vibes here when luke tells yoda where he promises that he won't fail him and not be afraid  \"oh  you will be  you will be \" they begin to fight until wenwu uses the same movement that he killed the gang who killed his wife on shang into the depths of water  believing that his son is dead  he does a jedi jump moment to the dark gates using the rings to break it down and free his wife  this makes the situation worse by releasing an army of soul eaters  in the village  xialing tries to ally with razor fist to help to take down the soul eaters  his mind is changed when the death dealer's soul was sucked out  he tells the ten rings to stop and help the villagers  i have to say  this part was terrifying and how he falls dead  no movement  it is crazy how death does that  back to shang chi  he regains consciousness with the help of the great protector rising out of the water  the great protector begins to eat the soul eaters  shang chi makes his way to his father to furthermore convince him that his wife isn't behind the dark gates  wenwu ignores this  continuing the fight  wenwu uses half of his rings at his son  but shang catches them and gaining control of 'em  the fight gets more intense to the point where the dweller is unleashed and slowly absorbs wenwu's soul  during his final moments  he gives his son the rings  the battle suffered many losses including master guang bo  chen launches an arrow at the dweller's weak port  causing it to be weakened  the great protector starts to kick the ever living crap outta it  making it explode  in the aftermath  the villagers attend a ceremony as the lanterns of those who died slowly \"swam\" across the ocean  finally  it was all about a true story where shang was explaining his recent adventure to a couple  obviously  they don't believe him just until wong uses his yellow sparkly thing bringing shang and katy to discuss the rings  we get a cameo of captain marvel and bruce banner  this time  captain marvel didn't get another haircut  lol  interesting how professor hulk somehow returned to his human form  i strongly assume that his right arm is more painful since he returned as a human  in the end credits  we see xialing becoming the new leader of the ten rings there are a lot of fantastic characters here  starting off with shang chi  i have to say that he had an excellent performance where he seems to be brave  showing no cowardice to his father  has lovely chemistry with his best friend he had known for 10 years  katy  wants nothing to do with his family  often feels guilty for leaving xialing  i have to say  though  speaking of katy  i liked how she wasn't full on comedic throughout the film and became a badass  i do find it interesting that we have two archers now  hawkeye and katy  i quite like how we didn't have any romance (( besides wenwu's romantic relationship with ying li  ))wenwu  what to say on this  he is one of the best marvel villains ever  although  he wasn't one  and he had actual motives rather than being the usual mcu villain  but the storytelling is wonderful  he was a ruthless leader killing multiple people  then one day  he stumbled upon a woman  ditches away his organization  became a better caring &amp; loving man to raise two children until his wife was killed  seeking revenge on her murder  became a flawed father having no time toward his children like ditching xialing  what  a  tragic  story  i am starting to notice that phase 4 is exploring the effects of grief like wanda's love for vision  sylvie's hatred for the tva  and corrupted doctor strange trying to bring back his love  tony leung's performance killed it  i loved how they were ditching away with the mandarin stuff i have to say that the ten rings (( no  not the organization  )) is completely badass  more interesting than the repulsors  the mjolnir  stormbreaker  a million pound sharp edged metal frisbee  the iconic scepter  a cross bow that can do many things  a prosthetic titanium/vibranium arm that can overpower almost anything  quad blasters that go pew pew  the godslayer that can cut through anything  basic daggers  a laser cannon  yaka arrow that can travel by whistling  electroshock batons  carbon fibered specialized winged jetpack  and vibranium claws  wanda's psionic energy manipulation  size/insect manipulation  web shooters  eldritch magic  and the infinity gaunlet are the only cool things along with the ten rings  you can make an energy blast  put 10 rings on one arm to do a super punch  extend into a energy whip  shields  big jumps  etc  oh yeah  i forgot to mention  the fight between wenwu &amp; ying was god damn jaw dropping  wenwu is a 10/10 character for xu xialing  she became likable in the later halfs of the movie  her backstory is heartbreaking  because of her gender  she couldn't train with her brother shang  although  she learned to train on her own  rather than her unpleasant behavior  she has great bonds with women  emotional  a really interesting relationship with her brother  for ying nan  she is marvellous  she dealt with the loss of her sister  and wise  i enjoyed guang bo so much  he's wise  has a deep heart for his village  i was devastated of his death  trevor  i enjoyed so much for him and his deep relationship for morris  he is so fun! \"calm down  mate  i'm not actually dead  it's just a performance  play along \" i do wish that the death dealer was done better rather than being treated dirty  he was badass  completely threatening  and the same potential of taskmaster  the movie has excellent pacing  that's all i have to say</th>\n",

              "      <th>overall  i really liked the film  but i don't think it's what the reviews are making it to be  definitely one of the most over praised ever  in my opinion let's start with the things i liked  and this is definitely the beginning  the first act  mandarin's brutal battle with the armies hints at the epic and great effects that await us and the power of the rings  also  the director manages to introduce us to the main characters   shang chi and katie and the great chemistry between them  with very few and correctly shot scenes  the two radiate a very pleasant warmth and you really feel their friendship  we also witness two of the best made battle scenes i've seen in a movie  the one on the bus and on the scaffolding around the skyscraper  maybe that's where the problem is rooted and the film gets a little underwhelming over time  because these scenes were so good that nothing could reach them afterwards  especially the cg fest  which turned out to be the finale another plus i can point out  as a consequence of the above is the directing itself  the cinematography and the music  the film looks and is shot beautifully  colorful when needed  without overdoing it  the same with the gloomy scenes (which makes me angry that i had to wear the damn 3d glasses again)  scenes inspired by old chinese classics such as \"hero\"  \"house of the flying daggers\" and \"tiger and dragon\" were great  poetic and with enough respect for these old classics! the battle scenes were also an absolute peak and as i said   the scaffolding scene can be a master class on how to shoot one  the music also contributed very nicely with the light chill beats  perfectly complementing the urban scenes and the epic asian notes included in the fairytale segments  some of the acting surprised me a little   most were good  especially tony leung as the father  and  would you believe it   aquafina or whatever that name is  i didn't expect her to surprise me so pleasantly at all  but i liked her even more than the main guy simu  who was honestly wooden at times  despite his charisma  congratulations to the actress who played shong chi's mother  she was wonderful  i will also mention the relatively funny cameo from a rather controversial character that we remember from iron man 3 :)and in this line of thought   to say the things that did not work for me  namely  the fairy tale / fantasy part  as well as the seriously slugish second act  where i think they went too far with the flashbacks  the exposition and the dramatization  i don't know  maybe the problem is in me  but as things started to move into the dimension of fairy tales and fantasy  somehow that took me out of the movie  it came to me too abruptly and unexpectedly to be so made up  especially after the super well done scenes happening on earth  also  when the whole mystery began to unfold  there were too long scenes with silence  dramatic looks  explanations  exposure  flashbacks  that started to lose me a little and roll my eyes the final act  unfortunately  is a typical marvel / superhero epic with a bit too much monsters  creatures and fiction that i could handle  i understand that the film is a cultural phenomenon  especially for china  and they wanted to weave culture  mythology  legends into one  but even though we have witnessed all sorts of cosmic and fantastic wonders in this universe   something about these dragons and wonders took me out slightly from the movie  i would accept them much better in animated / comic form however  the very way it ends  where things became more grounded again and even the characters explained with self irony and joked about what happened  was great and definitely raised my rating slightly  also the fantastic mid credit scene after all that has been said  it is very difficult for me to find a correct assessment of the film  on the one hand  seven is not enough for me  eight is too much for me  so i nail it to * 7 5 / 10 *</th>\n",

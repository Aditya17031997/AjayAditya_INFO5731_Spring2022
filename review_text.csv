0,Purchased this product advertised as fully unlocked. Inserted my sim card and it did not work. Contacted my service provider and they checked my IMEI number and it reported that the phone was still locked by the original carrier. Phone came in good condition just couldn't use any service provider.
1,I was feeling a bit skeptical after I placed my order but I was proven wrong! The phone looks brand new besides some very minimal/ light scratches (almost impossible to notice) and the battery life is still at 100%. I also like that there was a screen protector on the phone
2,Phone was not unlocked could it use it
3,The screen came cracked and popped out of the frame. Hopefully the return process goes smoothly.
4,"This is the best experience I have ever had with buying a renewed phone. The phone came in it‚Äôs original box with original charger and cable and the phone looks excellent, not one scratch on it absolutely beautiful and the battery health was at 100%. I definitely recommend the seller GoOverstock, as I will definitely be buying from them again."
5,Be careful mine had a scratch on screen very small but still üò¢ their Used. People dont want used I phones with scratches
6,"I fought it for the longest time but I finally gave in and upgraded to the iPhone 11 from the iPhone 7. I looked other places online, but the price was way out of my price point. I felt comfortable buying this phone from Amazon because it was certified refurbished and I‚Äôm still happy that I did."
7,The box didn‚Äôt come with ear phones. The phone kept turning off by itself after set up. Some apps had to be deleted before they‚Äôd quit shutting off on their own.

  ¬†I just wanna tell everybody this is NOT A SCAM!!!! This phone is so amazing, great battery life, Face ID everything. Unfortunately mine didn‚Äôt come in an iPhone box but I was too much worried about that but it did come w/ a charger . Please get this phone  don‚Äôt let any of these reviews scare you! I will be doing a month review on this phone for more updates. Brand new and unlocked I‚Äôm paired with cricket so everything transferred over so easily!"
9,"My iPhone came with a big scuff on the corner (aluminum frame)  and a small (not really noticible) scratch on the front and back of the phone. I got the 64 gb product red unlocked iPhone 11 which was, I believe a Verizon unlocked phone. My phone came in the iPhone 11 apple box with a original apple charger and original apple brick.  When I set up my phone I just put in my T-Mobile sim and the phone started working with my data. I did not need to get it activated or anything."
10,"Working well so far, looks new."
11,"My phone re start over and over again, that's so sad because the i phone looks like newüò∂"
12,"I received my phone a day early and it came exactly as I imagined. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone on the internet, but I truly have no complaints. The phone came in perfect, like new condition and has been working great with my carrier and in general.Came with a charger and charging block as mentioned in the description. It also came with a screen protector that was already put on the screen! That was an awesome and much appreciated touch. There‚Äôs also 60 day warranty and free returns just in case something were to happen.I‚Äôm incredibly pleased. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"
13,"Amazon renewed phone. Was expecting minor cosmetic issue as described, however there was a decent size mark above the volume down button and the volume down button does not function properly. Contacted amazon and the seller and have not gotten this resolved."
14,"been using iphones for a a long time. i needed a new one & saw this online for a good price. i dont have any complaints it works great. camera quality is amazing. it came with a charger, but *did not come with headphones* and it did not come in the classic ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù packaging which didnt bug me but other people might care. i definitely recommend but if you want the headphones id buy them separately."
15,"Very disappointed with this purchase: Was same price as a brand new Apple I-Phone. This phone had 2 deep scratches on screen, did not come with earphones, was not an Apple charging cord, (although it had a sticker saying it was), was not an Apple charger. Also was never able to install I cloud."

  ¬†I purchased this iPhone 11 because it said it was unlocked. I have always owned unlocked iphones and never had troubles with them. I live in Guatemala. This iPhone 11 was working for a few days but all of the sudden ""stopped"" recognizing my SIM card. As you can see in the video the issue is not my SIM card because it works in my old and unlocked iPhone 8. Since I am not in the USA I lost almost $600. Beware, don't buy this product. It is a complete scam."
17,"This is not a scam!! I repeat this is not a scam! I love iPhones, I always want a nice good working phone that I know won‚Äôt take a dump in me because me being a single mom I need to beable to keep in touch with school and grandpa so if anything happens I‚Äôm aware right away! I love this phone! No scratches no dings! It‚Äôs like brand new!!! It looks new! And works like new!!! Comes with a screen protector! I am in love!!! The battery capacity is 100%! And it‚Äôs a killer deal for the price of this kind of phone!! It‚Äôs well worth it and it came in two days with my Amazon prime earlier than it said it would! You will be happy! I highly recommend!"
18,Don‚Äôt trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word.  Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When  I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I‚Äôve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.
19,I haven‚Äôt had the phone for 2 weeks and now the power button isn‚Äôt working and now the seller isn‚Äôt responding !!!
20,"IPhone was shipped in two-day delivery. The box inside of a FedEx bag came opened but the FedEx bag itself was untouched, so I presume it was not completely closed before sealing the bag. The phone came with no scratch or sign of usage at all, a screen protector (nice touch) and generic certified usb cable and charger. No earphones as described. Battery life is 100%. So far it looks and works good. Im only a little concerned that it gets quite hot in the back.Im only doing the math and believe $639.99 is still a high price for a refurbished. If you want replace the generic stuff by purchasing an original charger + cable + earpods + connector, the total price will go beyond a brand new phone."
21,"""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice"" is is a false statement in their add for Amazon. When I received the phone there was a paper inside the box saying not compatible with Sprint or Boost Mobile. I happen to use one of those carriers, and rather then erasing all my info that I already had transferred from my old phone to the new phone and mailing the phone back I chose to switch carriers which was an additional pain. So BuySPRY won in the end but I will never purchase from them again."
22,Great product. Looks and works exactly like new
23,"Every things right,  battery came with %100 capacity,  and it arrived 4 days early through FedEx,  i got the color and device storage I ordered.  Theres a few scratches on the bare screen which prove its used,  (i peeled the screen protector it came with off so i could put my tempered glass one on) but theyre invisible when a screen protector is on.  Phone is lighting fast and im just so happy!I had some doubts when buying this phone because there weren't enough reviews on it and it was used.  But its entirely like new,  although you dont get the unboxing experience of buying it brand new,  and earbuds arent included. Im happy i got a discount and that i didnt buy a new one and just have this one sit around and get scrapped for parts or something. I honestly dropped $690 bucks on this thing and i was gonna go ballistic if it didnt show up,  but it came early and im so relieved and happy with it,  its absolutely beautiful. Also the battery life on this for an iphone is great,  i came from a 2016 SE,  so a big change."
24,Excelente tel√©fono üëç y muy buena la c√°mara lo recomiendo 100%
25,My son loved this phone. We had no problems setting anything up. Worked perfect. In brand new apple box as well
26,I just received this phone on Friday(3 days earlier than expectedü§óü§ó)and it is absolutely lovelyü§©. It came in a generic box with an apple compatible charger and cable. No scratches or imperfections that I can see at this time . The battery capacity is 100%. It looks and works like a brand new device.üòÅüòÅ‚úÖ
27,The phone comes in the original iPhone box which was a nice bonus and difference between other companies that send unlocked iPhones in normal cardboard boxes and it works perfectly
28,"I shopped around a lot for a renewed, refurbished iPhone 11. This was not the cheapest but really close. The selling point for me is that it comes with a 90 day warranty and refund policy and is sold through Amazon Prime. We received the phone 4 days ago. Upgraded and transferred everything from the iPhone 7 to the 11 flawlessly. Plus, the phone had no cosmetic issues at all. It looks brand new. We have bought a refurbished iPhone 7 and now this 11. Both worked perfectly."
29,"As far as buying this product from this specific seller, my experience has been great! Nothing to complain about. There were no scratches in the glass display, not to mention there weren‚Äôt any on the back glass or camera lenses either. But as far as the phone itself, I‚Äôm an android person but my first smartphone happened to be an iPhone and I had gone through a couple generations of them. I‚Äôm pleased to say that this device feels great but, it‚Äôs still an iPhone and to that, I mustn‚Äôt give a full 5 star review. Android gang."
30,I am absolutely happy with my purchase! I‚Äôve gone through the reviews and was ready to order right after. The only thing is my battery health was at 84% as I seen others with 100% which is fine by me. It‚Äôs nothing to go get a new battery when and if that time comes. As you see in the pictures the phone is in great condition annnndddd it‚Äôs unlocked so you can use any phone service for it. I‚Äôm digging the picture quality especially after upgrading from the iPhone X to this. What a difference a upgraded phone makes! It came with a cute case plus a charger. If you‚Äôre looking into this phone I‚Äôd say go for it. I‚Äôm on day 1 and I‚Äôm excited!!! (UPDATE! April 18th) I‚Äôm 1 month in with the phone and it‚Äôs still working great no issues at all.
31,"Work totally fine so far, I‚Äôm satisfied with the functionality. But It didn‚Äôt come with earphones."
32,"This phone is great! (Please excuse the somewhat blurry pics, I have shaky hands) The battery health was already at 100% and its has barely any cosmetic damage. Save for a super tiny little nick at the top which is barely noticeable unless I shine a camera directly at the area. Also, the phone came preinstalled with a screen protector! I guess its a bit of a minus that it doesnt come with headphones, but I already have airpods, so that doesn‚Äôt bother me. It‚Äôs something to keep in mind when you purchase anything from Amazon Renewed. The phone came in four days early too which is dope."
33,So pleased. The phone came with a screen protector on it already even! And we‚Äôll placed! No scuffs. Phone is seriously like brand new. Battery is 99%. I was skeptical after a bunch of 1 star reviews but figured I would try it because there is a 90 day guarantee and return. Don‚Äôt feel scared about this deal. Try it out. You will be pleased.I got the black 256gb unlocked iPhone 11 just FYI.
34,"After only 3.5 months the phone is completely dead and will not charge.  Took to Apple store and was told it would have to be replaced.  WTH!  Ordered and received early October 2020.  Started having charging issues last week and now it is completely dead.  And wouldn't you know it is past the return date by a mere 12 days.  Come on Amazon, you sold me this product you need to stand behind it or at least replace or refund something that lasts only days longer than the return window.  BS!"
35,"Well I got the iPhone 11 yesterday and it currently right now will shut off every 5-10 mins , I have tried multiple times to contact the carrier and they haven‚Äôt emailed me back or nothing which I spent 700$ on a phone I‚Äôd like to get atleast a phone I can have a conversation on .. I don‚Äôt even want my money back I just want my phone fixed because it‚Äôs honestly a great phone but I think you should get a better technician that works on your phones cause I even called Apple to see what they recommend I do (that‚Äôs what they said ab the technician ) but I‚Äôm just disappointed I was so excited now I just feel ripped off ):"
36,Bought refurbished I‚Äôm assuming only open box as the item seemed 100%brand new would recommend the seller
37,It's ok
38,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†The lock screen is flickering and getting blurry .. everything else seems to be fine , I tried to restart it again but it‚Äôs not working"
39,For the most part everything is okayDifferent parts of the screen won‚Äôt work during certain timesSo I have to lock and unlock my phone constantly Nd hope it will work afterWhile writing this review I can‚Äôt even hit the bottom right corner to add punctuation unless it comes up from autocorrectWhen I contacted the company they told me to hard reset it and it should work afterThat worked for less than a day and I don‚Äôt want to have to hard reset my phone every other day for it to work when I spent seven hundred dollarsCan‚Äôt even use numerical charactersUpdate I reached out to them again saying their advice didn‚Äôt work and haven‚Äôt received a response and it‚Äôs been a week
40,If you‚Äôre thinking about buying this buy it right now! I had iPhone 7 and wanted another phone I can have years to come it took me two months to buy this because how much money. When I did BOY! I have never been so happy! I can‚Äôt express how happy and thankful iam to this company! Everything transferred over in less than 15 mins it was activate it with metro pcs within 10mins. I do have small hands so sometimes it‚Äôs hard to hold with one hand haha! The camera is awesome sound is awesome the color is greatit‚Äôs fast and up to date! It came with a screen protector you can buy another one. Get a good case I got mines from metro than I order one from red bubble. My watch paired fast dude! Buy this ASAP you‚Äôll love it calls is cool it drops when I‚Äôm in a dead zone but that‚Äôs my services obviously turning the phone off tho is weird af üòÇüòÇ buy a real apple charger got mines from Meijers for $20 charge my phone fast the battery life was 100%! It last about a 11 hours until it dies
41,Recomended!!
42,I can‚Äôt send messages to anyone who doesn‚Äôt have an iPhone. The power button doesn‚Äôt work correctly and often times Siri doesn‚Äôt respond. The only way to get the issue corrected is to be without a phone until the seller sends me a new one. I‚Äôd never buy again or from this company.
43,"Certified. Refurbished. Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right? Do not buy from this organization if you plan to gift. Please do your loved one a favor and keep BUYSRY's mediocre business and risk to yourself. Just buy her something new you cheapskate! Good luck and stay healthy."
44,"I have never bought a used phone before and I've never bought one online. I always went through my carrier. However, this time I was ready to save some money and get an unlocked phone. I was a little nervous but I did some research and then took a risk since I had time to return it for a full refund if it didn't work out. The phone came in perfect condition and works like new. To me, I can't tell the difference between this phone and a brand new one! I've been using it for about 4 days and I've had no issues! Definitely worth the risk."
45,Great phones... I initially bought one for my daughter and ended up ordering one for myself
46,"It‚Äôs a refurbished phone I don‚Äôt mind that it didn‚Äôt come in an original box, the phone itself is in very very good shape, I was so skeptical about buying this phone from amazon since it‚Äôs my first time buying a phone online but it is in very good condition! No cracks no scratches ! Looks brand new !! Seems to be working fine for now hopefully it stays that way I just need to see if it‚Äôll work with my carrier, it came with a screen protector which was a nice touch :) really happy with the productUPDATE!!!! After a Month or two of having it, it still works really great! Batter life is long and it charges super fast. Highly recommend"
47,"I got this when the battery life in my last phone, the LG V30 started tanking. I figured that I could easily try the current iPhone and sell it again if I didn't like it. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything this phone offers.I'm going to start with the battery life, because that is the because surprise I have had coming to this phone. On day one with my old phone, I would get at max 6 hours of SoT (screen on time) before the phone would die. That was typically enough for me to go from 6am to 10pm with enough left over for me to not feel worried about dying in the middle of the day. Prior to buying this phone that battery life dropped to roughly 3.5-4 hours of SoT before dying.This new (refurbished I know) phone easily gets ~8 hours of SoT, easily going even higher depending on what I'm doing. I can go a full two days without a charge. That's with bluetooth on 24/7. To say I am happy with the battery is an understatement.The other features, are also pretty good. Not anything that blows me out of the water, but definitely at least as good as the other competition. The face unlock, which I assumed was going to be terrible, is much better than I expected. I would still prefer a fast fingerprint sensor, but this thing does the job almost as well. I have had a few instances where it refuses to recognize me on the first attempt, but they are uncommon. The camera is as good as you would expect from a modern smartphone, with several extra features that are actually useful in certain circumstances.Long story short: I will definitely be sticking with this phone for the foreseeable future."
48,"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, Red - Fully Unlocked (Renewed) arrived in only two days nicely packaged and looks brand new! Only one, barely noticeable scratch on the screen and a very tiny scratch on the side that you can notice if you hold it really close to your face. Overall I'm very satisfied. I've had the phone for 24 hours now, works really well and fast and battery is still going since I charged it yesterday, it's at currently at 29%. If any unusual changes occur in the near future I'll update my review but I doubt it since the phone is in near perfect condition"
49,I received a phone that had a crack in the screen which wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal but the something was off with camera though compared it my boyfriends phone who ordered the same one from Apple and I think it was replaced with a different one and the biggest problem with the phone was that it‚Äôs kept restarting I thought maybe I was doing it by accident but no it would turn off while I didn‚Äôt have it my hand but using my AirPods . I also had problems trying the return the phone as the shipping label they sent roundly be taken by fedex and I had to pay myself all around you‚Äôd be better off buying new phone from Apple it ended up being cheaper .all around I paid $780 for the phone unlocked from Apple don‚Äôt waste your money
50,"This review is based on the renewed status of the phone and not of the iPhone itself. I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories. I thought it'd be worth it to save $100 or more since my last experience went so well. Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal. Thankfully Amazon has a longer return period if the phone doesn't work out for you, but I only needed a few minutes with the phone to know that I'd rather buy a new phone from Apple for $100 more."
51,"This was an amazing buy from Kiss Electronics. No issues with phone operation so far, only just received & setup. Was packaged nicely & came with an adapter and a charging cable (no headset). Iphone product Red body was in good condition. Small scratches on upper corner . Very very happy with purchase"
52,"A BIG thank you for selling iPhones on Amazon! I wanted this phone so bad and couldn‚Äôt get my hands on it anywhere unlocked. I am so glad I could buy in through Amazon, This is how we get everything so we knew it was reliable. The phone did not come in an apple iPhone box, but a box just the same with a charger no headphones. But I could care less because all I wanted was the phone. Works great, you wouldn‚Äôt even know the difference. I have since told friends and family to do the same when looking for a new phone. Plus it was much cheaper then I found it anywhere else. Very pleased that I got exactly what I wanted for an amazing deal!"
53,camera came slightly scratched but overall a good purchase
54,"Just got my iPhone 11 today and I was so anxious of using it but had to wait 2 hours for everything to set up. After that a message popped up saying that my phone screen may not be genuine so I freaked out because it supposed to be all ortigal? Right well apparently the screen is not authentic at all... hope my review and evidence works to y‚Äôall. I scanned my phone with a program called 3utools, hope it works."
55,Works great.
56,Not user friendly. I might have to return it. I have to learn how to clean it before I send it back as it loaded my pictures from my other phone.
57,"No scratches or damage on the screen, or, for that matter, any part of the phone! SO happy I took the plunge and bought the phone, it has been well worth it so far!-no scratches or dents anywhere-battery capacity 100%-unlocked & everything as advertised"
58,"The phone came in with scratches on it but after I put the screen protector on you can‚Äôt see it and whenever you put the screen protector on it‚Äôs gone have some like bubbles I put it on over and over and the bubbles seems to not go away but, overall it‚Äôs good I guess it doesn‚Äôt have YouTube but I‚Äôm satisfied I guess but, the price should‚Äôve been lower than this since it‚Äôs refurbished and still come in the mail kinda mess up. The face recognition works fine battery was fine the setup was good only took 5 mins."
59,"So I gave the phone another chance after it kept glitching on me but it‚Äôs definitely a no. The phone already came cracked on the side where the lock button is, I guess that‚Äôs why the phone won‚Äôt power off for me to complete the activation. Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn‚Äôt hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I‚Äôve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care. They fix these phones that‚Äôs broke & try to sell them thinking they‚Äôve found a dummy because most won‚Äôt return the phone but I had a little time today & will have more when I get my refund today. I‚Äôll give the phone one star because the phone takes nice back pictures but THATS IT."
60,"My sister is absolutely in love with this phone üòç she was so surprised when I gave it to her, very fast shipping packaging was great."
61,"Received phone.  It looked good, then after charging it overnight the screen was a jumble of blurred vertical lines.  Amazon insisted we had to deal with the seller.  Could not clear the phone as the screen didn‚Äôt work.  Communication from the seller was scripted, they never really answer your questions.  Sent phone back to seller.  They refunded 1% and kept 99% as a restocking fee!  Then we had to force Amazon to deal with it to get a full refund.  Horrible seller, buyer beware!!!"
62,"It came in perfect condition, no scratches, nothing was wrong. The battery life was at 100 percent. I had no complaints. One thing I noticed was that the app snapchat is glitchy on the phone. If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that,  it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down. Even after saving all my contacts to my sim card, when I inserted it, none were there. So it's crucial to remember your contacts."
63,I paid $ 720 but the screen was scratched.  Should not be bought at this shop.
64,"I requested an exchange because the phone I got reset on me a few times while trying to set it up. Like I had to redo adding my wifi and password, all the settings like country, prompts, etc. They made the return process so easy so I‚Äôll give them props for that! Just got the ‚Äúexchange‚Äù item. IT‚ÄôS THE SAME EXACT PHONE I SENT BACK! I know because I recognize the small set of scuffs in the top right hand corner. They asked if I wanted the same color and I specified if it was available or I‚Äôd even take a white if it was a better option. They just replaced the little back sticker that came off when I had to clean it the first time I received it because it arrived dirty( like how phones get when they‚Äôve been on a case for a while and the random dust/gunk that kind of accumulates) and added a fancy gold charging cord instead of the play white one. For paying over $400 for a renewed phone like this one I‚Äôd say OVERPRICED. They should base their prices off of how the phone looks and not just charge the same for all phones. I can say I‚Äôm disappointed to say the very least. The battery life is 86%.  The renewed iPhone 8plus I ordered 2 years ago (from somewhere similar) came at 97% battery life. That‚Äôs why I had high hopes it would be fine to order renewed.Will not order from again when the time comes to get a different phone. I‚Äôve learned my lesson."
65,"Slight micro scratch on the screen, but overall good condition for an open box"
66,"I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised with this transaction.  I‚Äôm a true skeptic and regularly conduct extensive research when making this type of purchase.  The phone doesn‚Äôt come in original packaging and the cord and wall adapter are definitely not Apple products. The usb connection on the wall adapter had was bent and i could not slide the usb into the adapter....that was tossed into the trash.  With that said, the product I care most about was the phone itself and it is exactly as advertised.  It stared right up and went through start up process.  My entire phone was transferred within an hour and I was on my way.  I‚Äôve been using it for about 4 days now and the battery life is strong and all the features work perfectly (no sticky buttons, etc).  I would definitely recommend this vendor if you only care about getting the iPhone as it‚Äôs supposed to be.  If you‚Äôre concerned about packaging and having a ‚Äúuniquely‚Äù Apple experience, you may want to pay the additional $400 at the Apple store."
67,"Phone doesn‚Äôt work on the providers they say it will. I really wish I‚Äôd paid attention to the 1-star ratings before I bought it.Pros: the phone is in great condition and it works wellCons: It‚Äôs not really unlocked ‚Äì or its some weird hardware configuration. It won‚Äôt connect to the providers they said it would. I was on a Verizon network and bought the phone so I could switch to sprint. It didn‚Äôt work on sprint. I contacted the seller‚Äôs support, and they gave me lots of things to try. I tried them long enough for the return window to pass. Then they basically said, too bad for me.If I had it to do again, I‚Äôd spend a little more and get something that works properly. Or just returned the phone and got another."
68,"If there was a way to leave a 0 star, I would. I got the phone in the mail, super excited to get it up and running, and it wouldn't turn on. I called Apple and was on a call with them for 30 mins and they couldn't help me get the phone on either. Needless to say, I'll be returning the phone without even getting a chance to use it."
69,All they did was replace the glass. The sides of the phone are all scratched up not refurbished at all and the cables included are all aftermarket... not really pleased with the way the phone looks at all. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a new one.
70,The Face ID do not work I tried everything to fix it  In wouldn‚Äôt buy from dis seller again
71,"Got my phone in two days rather than five standard shipping days! I was happy it came sooner than expected!  I was nervous about ordering a renewed phone online because I didn‚Äôt want to spend $700 on a phone not knowing if it  was damaged or not, but I‚Äôm happy to say it came like brand new with no dents or scratches!! I‚Äôm so happy I made this choice because it saved me almost $300 from ordering on the apple website. Would definitely take the chance if your looking to buy the phone from them. The phone came in a different box with just a charger, FYI."
72,"The iPhone 11 my son bought from BuySPRY technically works in the sense of being a very expensive digital camera and ipod, but not as a phone.  In august, we were contacted by our phone service provider Xfinity Mobile who said the phone was flagged for being from Asia, possibly counterfeit, and therefore unusable on their system.  Checking with Verizon, ATT, and T-Mobile with IMEI, the answer was the same - nobody wants this phone on their system.  We contact BuySPRY who asked for the IMEI, which I immediately sent, and they have ghosted us since. We are now out of the return window, and my son has wasted his money."
73,"What an awful, frustrating month long experience. Save yourself a ton of grief and aggravation and do not buy a phone here!! This whole experience was tragic. The phone was an absolute complete and total piece of worthless junk. The key board didn't work, it constantly froze up, it muted itself whenever it felt like it. I initiated a return process after the hassle of importing everything onto it then having to reverse the process when I realized the phone was possessed. I contacted the company and their big solution was to have me take the phone to a local repair shop like it was a pair of shoes and get an estimate for repairs, send them said estimate and they would then reimburse for the repair cost if the estimate was to their liking.NO WAY!! Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned! Don't waste your time with this company. they sell you junk and make it as hard as possible to return for a refund. one month out and I still don't have a phone. Waiting till Black Friday at this point and buying new."
74,"I was going to buy my girlfriend a bigger phone than her SE2020‚Ä¶ but was worried about her not liking it not having a home button. Her fingers don‚Äôt always have a good tactile feel and has a hard time doing screen motions.She wasn‚Äôt to keen on the Face ID either.So after looking at the IPhone XR, XS Max and the 11, I decided to go with the 11. I looked through about 15 vendors and their review scores. This vendor came through pretty well. There is a small nick in the paint right above the power button, case hides it though.The battery is at 100%!! I did have some questions about the ear speaker. The calls were sounding crackly. I called Amazon and got disconnected but they emailed me and said to try and brush the ear speaker out. I did it and it seems to have helped but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs 100%.The phone is great, It came with a screen protector on it and I don‚Äôt like those at all but it is on there very well so I‚Äôll leave it for now.My girlfriend is getting my IPhone 8+ which has a bigger screen than hers and retains the home button.Overall happy with it, it does take some time getting use to it without a home button but Face ID works well."
75,it seemed like new the thing I didn‚Äôt like is was it wasn‚Äôt in its original boxing didn‚Äôt even last three months and the screen started bugging out since it‚Äôs refurbished and the seller won‚Äôt help me by swapping it or giving you a refund. I‚Äôm mad and upset 700$ for a busted iPhone 11 what a rip off:( don‚Äôt buy this product as it‚Äôs just a broken phone. Better off buying a new one. They won‚Äôt even swap or anything. Like I just want a full refund n to send it back:( very unpleasant
76,Speakers are blown and very crackly. Cannot hear it is so bad.
77,"Not gonna lie, after reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy a Renewed phone, but in the end I'm super glad I did it! My phone came a day earlier than I expected, was nicely packaged, and already had a screen protector applied (no bubbles!). Set up and transfer from my old 6+ was simple. Got my apple watch transferred over. Cameras all work great, face ID has no issues so far, etc. Obviously it's been less than a day, but so far, so good! ‚ô•"
78,"Keep in mind these items are refurbished, which means someone else has had them - it may have a screen cover or already have knicks and chips. Based on my experience - there's a huge chance it could have been opened and repaired. If the phone was opened and the water resistant seal wasn't sealed correctly - you may lose the water resistant rating that these phones should have. There's a small chance of that happening, but it could still happen. Good thing - you have an extended 90 day return policy when it comes to Amazon refurbished returns.If Amazon offered unlocked, new phones - I would go that route - unfortunately they don't."
79,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I couldn‚Äôt have made a wiser decision about this iPhone 11. First off, it‚Äôs almost $60 cheaper than a brand new one, which is practically a steal. Then, it arrives 3 days early, who doesn‚Äôt love that? Lastly, I have boost mobile as a phone provider, so purchasing the phone totally unlocked was the way to go, walking into the store and getting the phone activated with the plan I already have took about 10 minutes, all I needed was a SIM card to be put in, which is $10.To anyone worrying about buying this and it being a bust, fear not! I am over the moon, elated about my purchase. Worth every penny."
80,"Not gonna lie i was a little skeptical at first, im like dang did i really spend that much money on this what if its a scam? but im more than happy with the results. Battery health is on 100, phone is in perfect condition, came with new charger (no headphones tho), and there was no trouble transferring data from my old phone to the new one. I didnt even need to call my carrier to turn on the phone, just simply placed my sim card in. Definitely recommend this (if you dont mind the price lol)."
81,I only dislike that I didn‚Äôt receive headphones with the order. Everything else was on point
82,It‚Äôs refurbish but I got all brand new (apple box with original charger but missing the ear plug)
83,Cheapest iPhone 11 with 128gb that I could find online and I did ALOT of searching. Great buy! Love my new phone and the camera quality is amazing
84,The phone came in great condition. It works great! No lag! No issues! The battery life is great as well. I‚Äôm happy with the quality of the phone. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase! :)
85,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†** Edit **The seller provided a copy of the report showing all components were OEM, so it was simply an oversight on the Quality Control of the reseller - which is understandable, since it was only noticed upon angled inspection.*****This phone actually looked amazing - barely any scratches on the case and the screen appeared wonderful.... UNTIL it's held at an angle.  See video clip of how rippled / warbled the screen was - obviously a non-OEM quality replacement job.  And likely a poorly completed job by the seller.when applying screen protector(s) it became horribly noticeable - the protector couldn't fully adhere, leaving bubbles that couldn't rub out because the underlying screen wasn't smooth.  Disaster - waste of 2 protectors.Sad part - this was our 2nd refurb phone, the first had the original glass - but was pretty scratched up.  Not worth $500 as a refurb.  Returned, purchased from a different seller.  Lesson learned - just spend $50 more and buy it new from Apple.com"
86,"Wow... Went to activate phone and Verizon says the phone has been reported as STOLEN?!?!?  The girl at tech support was very nice and issued me a refund. She stated that the phone may not have been wiped clean by the previous owner, but either way, aren‚Äôt they supposed to check these things out before simply sending them out to buyers? Wow, I‚Äôd expect this on eBay, but not Amazon. ‚òπÔ∏è"
87,"Honesty is greatly appreciated these days. They delivered exactly what they promised: The phone arrived timely and it looked brand new. Everything worked smoothly as I expected. Unfortunately, I wasn't very thrilled about the phone size because I have always liked larger phones, so I contacted the seller for a refund. They kindly instructed me as to how to return the item in order to get a full refund back on my card. So far, so good. No complaints and I would definitely do business with these people again."
88,The product came in a timely fashion. I like that it came with a charger no headset though charger not original but can‚Äôt complain for the price you are paying great deal and the phone is great condition
89,"i desperately needed a new phone. my phone was starting to give out not only because my old phone was outdated (iPhone 7+), but it was starting to have so many problems. trust me, i did so much research and looking up what type of new phone i should get. i looked for months on end while my old phone was still in good condition. the iPhone 11 was honestly the best purchase i got, it‚Äôs so new and improved that i don‚Äôt ever wanna switch back to Samsung. i‚Äôve gotten used to the no home button that when i first got it, i didn‚Äôt know how to use itüòÇbest part was that i got the iPhone 11 unlocked and it works with my straight talk so i‚Äôm pretty pumped about that.thank you!!"
90,"I don‚Äôt write many reviews, however, there were some reviews about this iPhone that weren‚Äôt good. So I wanted to write a review myself.I highly recommend this phone.I will start by saying that I am impressed with the condition of my new phone. After inspecting the physical shape of the device I am very pleased to say that it looks almost perfect! Just looking at it you can't see anything wrong with it. But after looking closely there are a couple of very small scuff marks on the edge of the phone. But that's not a deal-breaker to me because that's covered by a case.The battery was charged more than 80% and the battery life of the phone is 100%. I have never owned a phone with a battery life over 85%. So far the batter has held a charge for 2 days after using it a good bit.Face recognition and other features work great I have no issues.The  biggest perk of this phone has to be the speaker during phone calls. It works amazing! I can hear the person I'm talking to without having on speaker phone. This is a huge perk."
91,Mine came with a dead pixel and 90 percent battery life. I returned it and just bought a new one. While you might get lucky and get a like new product it just isn‚Äôt worth it to me to save 50 dollars. They need to lower their price to around 100 less then new to make me ever think about buying a used phone again.
92,"I had everything transferred to my new phone, when suddenly my first phone call came in. To my surprise, you could barely hear any sound through the speaker despite the volume being turned up to max! Just my luck that the speaker doesn‚Äôt work considering I‚Äôm blind. Oh well, please give me my money back, and properly test your stuff.UPDATE- after ordering a brand new iPhone 11, which was not much more expensive than this renewed version, I realized that they didn‚Äôt even put the correct screen on the one I received from the seller. broken speaker, and incorrect screen. What else will I find wrong next? well, nothing, because I‚Äôm sending it back for a refund."
93,"I received the purple iPhone 11 in perfect shape! No scratches or cracks, it‚Äôs beautiful! Upgraded from the iPhone 7 Plus and this has been a wonderful transition. Easy to transfer info from iPhone to iPhone, too. Quick shipping, received a day early! Would not hesitate to buy used from them again!!"
94,"All is great with the phone! Came in two days. It was a great upgrade from my 8 plus, very adorable and was delivered to my door in two days conveniently instead of waiting in a Apple store like usual! Will buy again from amazon."
95,"The first phone I received had a problem with the charging port so I sent it back and had no problems with the return at all and another phone was promptly sent with no questions asked. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone, but it is now over a month old and working great and I was quite pleased that it came early by Fed-X.The phone came in a nice box that had the iPhone, Apple charger, charging block, and a screen protector already installed on the phone. I transferred the Sim Card from my iPhone 6 into the new phone with no problem. I didn't need to have the phone activated and everything from my old phone transferred readily.I received everything I ordered: iPhone 11, 256 gb, red, and unlocked. The phone looks brand new, has no dents or scratches on the screen. The battery is at 89% but other than that it could be a new phone instead of a refurbished one. The cameras quality is amazing.This is a great phone for the price as I could not afford to buy it new. I am totally pleased with the service that I received and would definitely recommend buying a refurbished phone to anyone needing a new phone but not able to pay the price for a new one!"
96,It was perfect! Even had a screen protector on it
97,I purchased the phone but when I took it to T-Mobil the device wouldn‚Äôt allow them to activate it. T-Mobil spoke with the customer care person from the seller but they couldn‚Äôt get it to work. So they told me to send it back. Prr rt onlem is now they don‚Äôt have anymore ‚Ä¶ at least not at that price. When asked what they can go for me they said nothing. After they receive the device they will credit me.I ended up buying a NEW one unopened and unused by T-Mobil for $599. Yeah it was $113 more but it is unused AND THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!! They should at least guarantee me another one at that price or at the very least do something for my troubles. The customer care person was nice and polite. But reiterated that there was nothing he can do and this happens. Unfortunately I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this company. But new or from Amazon‚Äôs renew store. They at least stand by there products and guarantee satisfaction.
98,"I had to send my first phone back as there was a scratched area on the screen about the size of a quarter. Called Amazon and got replacement ordered right away no problem with Amazon Renewed guarantee.Second iPhone comes and literally the same scratched area on this one too. If I didn‚Äôt know better, I would have thought they were the same phone based on the scratched area. I decided to put on a screen protector and see if that minimized the scratches, which it did.I believe the scratches are part of the refurb process or something, but would really have preferred the seller to have done better QC. I didn‚Äôt want to send back another time so I kept the phone. Because of that, I give 3 stars. Good price and responsive seller and Amazon was good to work with, but my wife‚Äôs phone from another seller didn‚Äôt have the screen scratch issue I did.Battery life seems good and no other issues with the phone. I feel like a scratched screen is kinda a big deal though since the screen is the phone basically. It also wasn‚Äôt a scuff as I could ever so slightly catch a finger nail on it and I tried to rub it off."
99,Sprint customers transitioning to T-Mobile with the merger. We purchased two iPhone 11s from this vendor. One phone activated just fine. Had problems activating the second phone. Spent 1 hr 40 min at the T-Mobile store. Second phone IMEI was reported 'Lost' by the previous owner. Easy return process and received our refund. Ordering another phone. Hopefully won't run into the IMEI issue again.
100,"I was very excited and looking forward to receive my new iPhone, but now I‚Äôm feeling I should‚Äôve paid the extra $50 to buy a new iPhone from Apple directly. At first glance the phone looks great! Came with a screen protector with no noticeable scratches/damages to the phone physically. When setting up my phone one of the first things I noticed was how loud the sound was, sound quality was off too. I had my audio low and on mute and notification rings were still loud. Then I got my first phone call and that‚Äôs I become disappointed. It was difficult to hear and understand the other person the phone, I had to switch to speaker to listen. It sounds staticky like if it weren‚Äôt plugged in correctly or if speakers were in the wrong place. I‚Äôm afraid to go to the Apple store to get the battery replaced (since the battery arrived at 88% health). I‚Äôve only been playing with phone for 6 hours now and have found questionable thing like the audio issue that have disappointed me in my purchase..."
